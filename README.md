# Hi, I'm Jackson

I'm an Infrastructure & Reliability Engineer based in Philadelphia with 10+ years of experience designing resilient systems and driving automation across hybrid cloud environments. I specialize in eliminating operational toil, architecting high-availability solutions, and modernizing legacy infrastructure. When I'm not building platforms or writing automation, you'll find me on hiking trails, carving ski slopes, or finding balance on the yoga mat. I'm equally at home debugging infrastructure-as-code, watching Formula 1, or getting lost in a good novel with a well-earned beer.

## What I Work With

**Cloud & Infrastructure**
- Azure, AWS, VMware vSphere
- Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, Ansible)
- High-availability architecture & disaster recovery

**Automation & Observability**
- PowerShell, Python, Bash, Ruby
- New Relic, Zabbix, Prometheus
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation

**Platform Engineering**
- Linux/Windows server architecture
- SQL Server clustering & availability groups
- Enterprise backup & storage solutions

## Recent Wins

- Architected three-node SQL availability cluster achieving 99.99% uptime
- Saved $400K+ annually through automated patching pipeline
- Reduced vulnerability exposure by 70% via systematic automation
- Cut server provisioning time from 4 hours to 15 minutes
- Led hybrid-cloud platform serving 300+ offices nationwide

## Featured Projects

### [PublicPowerShell](https://github.com/jackson-asmith/PublicPowerShell)

## Beyond the Terminal

When I'm not in the command line, I'm:
- Suffering Scuderia Ferrari fan (yes, *that* kind of reliability engineering)
- Chasing powder on the slopes
- Finding zen through yoga
- Reading everything from sci-fi to philosophy
- Exploring trails around Philly and beyond
